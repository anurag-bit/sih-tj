# Gemini Session Summary - docgen-go Service

This document summarizes the work performed on the `docgen-go` service during this session.

## Completed Tasks:

*   **Refactored Handlers:** The `summary`, `plan`, and `design` handlers have been refactored to use a common `CallOpenRouter` function, significantly reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.
*   **Corrected Default Model:** The `openrouter/auto` default model, which violated project requirements, has been replaced. The service now randomly selects an approved "free" model from the list provided by the user (`openai/gpt-oss-20b:free`, `google/gemini-flash-1.5`, `moonshotai/kimi-k2:free`, `google/gemma-3n-e2b-it:free`).
*   **Implemented Full Document Generation (`/v1/docgen/full`):**
    *   The `full` handler now supports sophisticated prompt composition.
    *   It intelligently distinguishes between JSON-returning prompts (e.g., executive summary, solution plan) and diagram-only prompts (Mermaid component, deployment, sequence diagrams).
    *   JSON-returning prompts are combined into a single LLM call for efficiency.
    *   Diagram-only prompts are handled with separate LLM calls, and their raw Mermaid code output is parsed and integrated into the response.
    *   The `FullResponse` struct has been updated to include `BreakdownMD` and `TradeoffsMD` fields, and `DataMD` was renamed to `DataModelMD` for consistency with prompt outputs.
*   **Implemented Export Functionality (`/v1/docgen/export`):**
    *   The `export` handler now generates PDF files from markdown content using the `gofpdf` library. Basic markdown-to-PDF conversion (headings and paragraphs) is supported.
*   **Improved OpenRouter Client Error Handling:** The `openrouter/client.go` file now includes more specific error handling for various HTTP status codes (401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 429 Too Many Requests, and 5xx Internal Server Errors), providing more user-friendly error messages.
*   **Enhanced Prompt Composition Logic:** The `generateCombined` function in `full.go` now robustly parses LLM responses into a generic map and then extracts and assigns values to the correct fields in the `FullResponse` struct, including special handling for diagrams.
*   **Dependency Management:** `go.mod` and `go.sum` files have been updated and tidied to reflect all new dependencies.

## Current State and Next Steps:

The `docgen-go` service is now a more robust and compliant internal service.

**Remaining Verification Tasks (to be performed from the project root):**

1.  **Build System Test:** Verify the `Dockerfile` implementation and ensure the service builds correctly.
2.  **Service Interaction:** Analyze how this service interacts with the rest of the services (backend and frontend). This will involve examining:
    *   `backend/app/routers/docgen.py` (FastAPI integration)
    *   Frontend code for the chat toggle and generation type selection.
3.  **Frontend Toggle/Chip Interaction:** Confirm the implementation of the frontend chat toggle for file generation and the choice of generation type (summary, plan, design, full).
4.  **Kubernetes Manifests:** Review `infrastructure/k8s/docgen-go.yaml` for correct deployment configuration.
5.  **CI/CD:** Examine `.github/workflows/docgen-go.yml` and deployment scripts.
6.  **Full Test Suite:** Run the project's full test suite to ensure no regressions and proper functionality.

## Overall Architecture (as understood from the prompt):

*   **Frontend:** React-based chat UI with a new "Generate Doc" toggle and scope selector.
*   **Backend (FastAPI):** Public API, proxies requests to the internal `docgen-go` service.
*   **DocGen-Go Service (Go):** Internal-only (ClusterIP), handles document generation, interacts with OpenRouter, and manages ephemeral artifacts.
*   **OpenRouter:** External LLM provider.
*   **Kroki (Optional):** Internal service for SVG rendering of diagrams.
*   **Ephemeral Storage:** `emptyDir` for temporary artifact storage.

## How to Restore This Session:

To restore the context of this session in a new Gemini CLI instance, you can:

1.  Start the Gemini CLI from the project root directory (`/home/anuragisinsane/Projects/sih-tj/`).
2.  Load the content of this `gemini_session_summary.md` file into the chat. You can do this by copying and pasting the content, or by using a tool if available in the future.
3.  Inform Gemini that this content represents the previous session's summary and that it should use this information as its working memory.
