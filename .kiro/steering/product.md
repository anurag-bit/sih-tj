# Product Overview

## SIH Solver's Compass

An AI-powered guidance platform designed to help engineering students discover and engage with Smart India Hackathon problem statements.

### Core Purpose
Transform how students discover and engage with SIH problems by providing intelligent search, personalized recommendations, and interactive problem exploration rather than overwhelming them with hundreds of static problem statements.

### Key Features
- **Semantic Search**: Natural language queries to find relevant problems based on skills and interests
- **GitHub DNA Match**: Personalized recommendations by analyzing user's GitHub repositories
- **Problem Conversation**: Interactive chat with AI to understand problem statements in depth
- **SIH Landscape Dashboard**: Data-driven overview with visualizations of the entire problem dataset

### Target Users
Second and third-year engineering students who are technically skilled in 1-2 domains but new to large-scale hackathons. They need guidance to find problems that match their skills and genuinely excite them.

### Design Philosophy
- **Empowerment over Prescription**: Provide tools to explore rather than just lists
- **Clarity over Clutter**: Every feature must reduce complexity
- **Interaction over Static Information**: Problems become conversations, not just text
